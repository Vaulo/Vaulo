### About me: 
Intrigued by curiosity, I've always had a passion for figuring out how things work, diving headfirst into the process of trial and error and learning. I firmly believe that nothing is static, and it is the constant evolution of the world that motivates me on a daily basis. With a deep interest in technology, I'm always reflecting on its impact on our lives.

In addition, I am enthusiastic about new ideas and challenges, always willing to explore uncharted territory and expand my horizons. My professional career has been marked by dedication, resilience and the ability to work as part of a team. I believe that true growth occurs when we challenge ourselves and collaborate with our colleagues.
